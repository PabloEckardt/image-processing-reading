Reading ppms is incredibly useful and fun. Webcams, and cctvs can easily output this format. 
It can be tricky as far a dynamic memory allocation but it is also very fast. Much, faster than generating these files.

Currently this code is setup to detect green pixels on a black background for another project that  I have but after a quick look 
to the documentation on ppm files type p6 anybody should be able to make this code their own. Having made it in c++ makes it
very intuitive to iterate over several ppm files very fast.
